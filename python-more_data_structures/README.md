# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description
This project focuses on advanced Python data structures such as **sets** and **dictionaries**, along with functional programming tools like **lambda**, **map**, **filter**, and **reduce**.

The goal is to understand **when and why** to use each structure efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What sets are and how to use them
- Common set methods
- When to use sets vs lists
- How to iterate over a set
- What dictionaries are and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries vs lists or sets
- What a dictionary key is
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What lambda functions are
- How to use map, filter, and reduce

- Python 3
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Files must end with a new line
- First line of each file: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code must follow **PEP8**
- All files must be executable
